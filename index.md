## What's new in version 1.2?
### New Additions:
- Dark Mode is now available on Android!
- Implemented easter egg guides, only Shadows of Evil for now but more maps will be added in the very near future without the need of an app update, so check back regularly!
- Implemented upgrade guides for different Wonder Weapons
- Implemented recommended GobbleGum loadouts (both premium and free) for each map
- Tools such as Simon Says and the Safe Code now remember your inputs allowing you to switch between any guide and the tools without losing progress!

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed an issue with the app logo not appearing on the splash screen whilst in dark mode on Android
- Fixed an issue that prevented the navigation bar using the correct styling
- Updated the DE and SOE icons for some of the tools
- Updated the loading icons
- Lots of backend preperation for Cold War!

## Why is *Map Name* not in the app?
The app has only just been released and will be updated with more and more maps over time, including Treyarch's new title rumoured to be releasing at the end of this year.

## What can be expected with future updates?
New maps, guides and tools will be added overtime. There will also be a challenge generator that is coming *soon*.
