## What is the App? 

Zombies guide is an app on iOS and Android that contains helpful guides and tools for all the Treyarch Call of Duty Zombies Maps.

## Where can I download the App?

## I have an issue / want to provide feedback
If you have any issues, questions, or just want to provide some feedback, please contact me: <support@zombiesguide.djr.li>

## Why is *Map Name* not in the app?
The app has only just been released and will be updated with more and more maps over time, including Treyarch's new title rumoured to be releasing at the end of this year.

## What can be expected with future updates?
New maps, guides and tools will be added overtime. There will also be a challenge generator that is coming *soon*.
